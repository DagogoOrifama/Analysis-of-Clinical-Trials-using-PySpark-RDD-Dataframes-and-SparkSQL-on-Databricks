# Analysis-of-Clinical-Trials-using-PySpark-RDD-Dataframes-and-SparkSQL-on-Databricks

This project centers around a comprehensive analysis of a dataset comprising clinical trials conducted over a three-year period. The analysis is complemented by an examination of pharmaceutical violations attributed to a specified list of pharmaceutical companies. Three distinct implementations were undertaken to ensure a thorough exploration of the data: Data Frame, Spark SQL, and Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDD). Furthermore, the project incorporates visualizations to effectively communicate and interpret the results derived from these diverse analytical approaches.

In the initial phase, data processing and analysis were conducted using Data Frames, a high-level abstraction in frameworks like Apache Spark that facilitates structured data manipulation. This implementation aimed to leverage the inherent efficiency and expressiveness of Data Frames for a comprehensive understanding of the clinical trial data and pharmaceutical violations.

Subsequently, Spark SQL, a module in Apache Spark for structured data processing, was employed as a key component of the project. This involved leveraging SQL queries to perform in-depth analysis on the integrated dataset, capitalizing on the declarative nature of SQL for intuitive and efficient exploration of relationships within the clinical trial and pharmaceutical violation datasets.

Additionally, the project delved into the utilization of RDDs, a fundamental data structure in Apache Spark designed for distributed processing. This approach provided a lower-level, fine-grained control over data manipulation, enabling intricate analyses tailored to the specific requirements of the clinical trial and pharmaceutical violation datasets.

To enhance the interpretability of the findings, the project also integrated visualization techniques. Visual representations of the results were employed to convey complex patterns and trends uncovered through the Data Frame, Spark SQL, and RDD analyses. This multi-faceted approach ensures a comprehensive exploration of the clinical trial and pharmaceutical violation datasets, leveraging different frameworks and methodologies to glean valuable insights from the wealth of available data.
